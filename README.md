Tips from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/anacondapython/discussion/markdown_syntax) on Markdown.

# Markdown
An inline link is the most common item in the web pages.  The syntax is to enclose the reference text in [ and ] and the hyperlink in ( )

Example: [OMSCS CS6460 Syllabus]()

Also, in markdown, paragraph tags are not required.  Put a blank line
between paragraphs to start a new paragraph.  Contiguous lines, with the
line break for readability, are rendered as a single paragraph.  Be sure
 to leave a leading or trailing space in a line if needed to get the
 proper formatting.

Blank lines are not needed following a special formatting character like '#'.
