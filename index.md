# Educational Technology

Welcome to the Educational Technology library. This library is
primarily assembled as an archive of resources for the Georgia Tech
OMSCS CS6460 class by the same name. Below you'll find several pages
with publications, media articles, original interviews, and other
resources on a number of different topics in Educational Technology.

An alternative version of this library, structured as a Udacity course,
is available [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud915).  The content
of the two versions of the library is equivalent: videos in the
alternative library are included as links below, and wiki pages below
are embedded in the alternative library.

This library is constantly growing. To catch up on the latest additions
across the entire library since your last visit, please see the
[change log](https://udacity.com/wiki/Educational_Technology/Changelog).
Generally speaking, this web site is constructed by course instructor
[David Joyner](http://www.davidjoyner.net/), and any text presented
in first-person can be assumed to come from him&nbsp;â€” or should I say,
from me.
